`Time Tracking`
The time invested in this project was significantly high, this was expected due to reasons like lack of programming experience in JAVA etc. 
However for the most part, there was a lot spent on being in a constant state of confusion as to how everything was to be built and my initial approach 
is different to the one of the current version.

The time spent on this project is estimated to be 80hrs
